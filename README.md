# PJM670 Software Development Assignment

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **PJM670 Software Development Assignment** repository. This project simulates a real-world scenario where you, as the project manager, are responsible for developing the software components of a new IT social media product. This phase of the project utilizes the **Agile** methodology to ensure flexibility, continuous improvement, and effective collaboration throughout the development process.

## Project Objectives

- **Develop innovative software solutions** that deliver engaging and user-friendly experiences for the social media platform.
- **Implement Agile project management practices** to facilitate iterative development, continuous feedback, and adaptability to changing requirements.
- **Ensure high-quality code** through regular testing, code reviews, and adherence to best practices.
- **Foster collaboration and effective communication** within the development team and with stakeholders.

## Agile Methodology

### Key Principles

The Agile methodology emphasizes the following core principles to guide the software development process:

1. **Customer Collaboration:** Engage with stakeholders and users to gather feedback and refine requirements continuously.
2. **Responding to Change:** Adapt to evolving requirements and market conditions with flexibility.
3. **Iterative Development:** Break down the project into manageable iterations (sprints) to deliver incremental improvements.
4. **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly assess and enhance processes, tools, and practices to optimize performance.
5. **Cross-Functional Teams:** Encourage collaboration among team members with diverse skill sets to achieve project goals.

### Sprint Structure

The project is organized into a series of sprints, each lasting **two weeks**. Each sprint follows a structured process to ensure steady progress and quality outcomes.

1. **Sprint Planning:**
   - Define the sprint goals and select user stories from the backlog.
   - Break down user stories into actionable tasks.
   
2. **Daily Stand-Ups:**
   - Conduct brief daily meetings to discuss progress, address obstacles, and synchronize efforts.
   
3. **Development:**
   - Implement features and functionalities as defined in the sprint backlog.
   - Write and maintain clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
   
4. **Testing:**
   - Perform unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing to ensure functionality and quality.
   
5. **Sprint Review:**
   - Demonstrate completed work to stakeholders and gather feedback.
   
6. **Sprint Retrospective:**
   - Reflect on the sprint process, identify successes and areas for improvement, and implement actionable changes for future sprints.
